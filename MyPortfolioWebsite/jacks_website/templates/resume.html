        <h3>Professional Summary</h3>
        <div class="resume-summary">
            <p>I am excited to bring my analytical skills and problem-solving abilities to back-end computer programming
                after my decision to change careers from an Organic Chemist to a junior developer. With a Certificate 4 in
                Information Technology (Programming) and a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and Sustainable Energy Management,
                I have developed a solid foundation in Python, Django and the Django REST Framework. Along with that I have
                good knowledge of React, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.</p>
            <p>The desire to understand how things work is the main reason I decided to become a programmer. My drive for
                self-improvement constantly pushes me to research new programming skills and approaches to problem-solving,
                resulting in my proficiency in using Visual Studio Code and Github to create my personal projects.</p>
            <p>As I transition into a career as a back-end developer, I am confident that my experience in laboratory work
                has provided me with transferable skills that will prove valuable in my new role. My ability to analyze
                data and troubleshoot problems will be an asset as I work to develop robust and efficient back-end systems.</p>
            <p>Overall, I am a driven and enthusiastic individual with a strong work ethic and a commitment to continuous
                learning. I look forward to bringing my skills and passion to a new career in programming.</p>
